# Numerical Analysis Final Task

This project consists of implementing various numerical methods using Python. The programming language for this task is Python 3.7, and you can use standard libraries provided by the Anaconda distribution.

## Overview

This task involves the following assignments:

1. **Interpolation**: Implement a function for interpolating a given function over a range.
2. **Intersections**: Implement a function to find intersections between two functions within a specified error margin.
3. **Integration**: Implement functions to approximate the integral of a function and find the area between two functions.
4. **Fitting**: Implement a function to fit a noisy function using least squares.
5. **Shape Area**: Implement functions to approximate the area of a shape and fit a noisy contour to a shape.
